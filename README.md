# Hello-world
I am just getting introduced into the world of programming and I hope I will advance my future with it.
As someone who has been interested with computers, (programming included) ever since I got a hold of an nintendo 64 controller for the first time, I have had a fascination on computers and I felt like I would want to be able to use the power of computer making to possibly tell stories without using a pen and paper.
